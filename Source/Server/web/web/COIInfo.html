You do not have to disclose payments from MIT for yourself or your immediate family. You also do not have to disclose payments from public or non-profit organizations if they are for lectures, seminars, or service on an advisory committee. Financial interests in a company that are the result of your holding shares in a mutual fund or being a member of the MIT retirement plan or similar pooled funds do not need to be reported, as long as you do not control the selection of investments.
<p>
This is a disclosure to MIT; the Institute will certify to the funding agency that you have disclosed the required information and whether the agency's conflict of interest policy has been satisfied. The information you disclose will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law, but if a conflict has been identified in connection with PHS-supported research and is being managed, that information must be disclosed to the agency.
<p>
There are two specific types of data requested: i) entity data, which requests information on financial entities which meet the thresholds identified by NSF and NIH, and ii) disclosure data, which requests information for individual NSF or NIH proposals. These two functions request the same information as the current paper-based system.
<p>
The financial entity information needs to be provided only once; the system allows additions and/or updates to financial entity information.  Since history is maintained, deletions are not allowed. Entities can be marked as "Inactive" in the event the individual has not had a financial relationship with the entity for 12 months or more.
<p>
The financial disclosure information needs to be submitted with each proposal (as currently done), but the entity data do not have to be reentered or resubmitted.
<p>
Revisions to the entity information may be done on- line and updated at any time.
<p>
Notifications will be mailed once a year to prompt individuals to submit an annual disclosure for pending proposals and active awards. Additional instructions are located within this document to complete the annual certification process. Individuals that utilize the web-based system will be able to take full advantage of the new streamlined annual certification process.
<p>
If you have trouble using the system, please send e-mail to <a href="mailto:coeus-help@mit.edu">coeus-help</a> for quick assistance as this address is monitored by several knowledgeable OSP staff members.
