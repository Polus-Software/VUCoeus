#Effort calculations
effortCalc_helpCode.1003=<html><b>Annualizing Effort for Academic and Summer Appointment Types</b><BR><BR>\
In order to annualize effort for faculty who have academic and/or summer salary, you must first \
put the effort in equal terms by changing the effort <BR>into months.  Therefore, for academic effort, \
take the % effort X the 9 months of the academic year to convert the effort into months.  \
For summer effort, <BR>take the percentage effort X the 3 months of the summer.  If there is effort \
in both terms, the calculation is:<BR><BR>\
20% of the academic year = .20 X 9 = 1.8 months<BR>\
33% of the summer term = .33 X 3 = 1 month<BR><BR><BR>\
To annualize, add the months together and divide by 12 (months of the year).<BR><BR>\
2.8 months / 12 = .233 or <b>23% annualized effort</b><BR><BR><BR>\
For faculty who\'s summer effort is 2 months out of the 3 summer months, effort would be 67% of the summer.  \
To annualize, <BR><BR>\
.67 x 3 / 12 = .167 or <b>17% annualized effort</b><BR><BR><BR>\
For faculty with only academic effort at 20%, to calculate annualized effort:<BR><BR>\
.20 X 9 / 12 = .15 or <b>15% annualized effort</b><BR><BR><BR>\
<b>A point to remember, the academic year runs from August 16 through May 15 and the summer term runs from <BR>\
May 16 through August 15.</b></html>
